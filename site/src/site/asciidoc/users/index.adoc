== Using Apache Training

The user documentation is divided into two main (overlapping)
catetories: producing your own presentations (authors), and presenting those
presentations (presenters). 

If you're interested in developing the code
that generates those presentations, those docs are link:../developers/contributing.html[here].

== Getting Started

If you just want to use one of the presentations we have published, as
is, click 'Presentations' in the site navigation menu, and
present directly from there. See also
link:presentation-tips.html[Presentation Tips] for a few ideas of what's
possible.

However, you will probably want to make some small edits to adapt the 
presentation to your topic, and for that you'll need to get a local
copy of the repository. This will require, at a minimum:

- Java 8 or newer
- Maven 3.3 or newer
- Git

Installation details for your preferred operating system are currently
**To Be Documented**.

To get a local copy of the tools and presentations:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-training.git
cd incubator-training
mvn install
```

This will install (if you don't have them already) all of the tooling,
and build the default presentations.

* link:new-presentation.html[Creating a new presentation]
* link:presentation-tips.html[Presentation tips]
* link:writing-slides.html[Writing slides]

== Technical details

Currently the setup uses https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] to write
content and builds the presentation using 
https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] and https://revealjs.com/#/[Reveal.JS].

== Using the latest development version

If you want to use the latest development version of the Apache Training tooling, please still use the latest released archetype. Otherwise, the archetype plugin will not be able to find the `SNAPSHOT` version of the archetype. As generally most changes apply to the parent being used in the slides module, you can update to the latest version by:

Adding the following section to the generated `pom.xml`:

```
  <!-- Make Snapshots of Apache projects available -->
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>apache-snapshots</id>
      <url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
      <releases>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
      </releases>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
```

After adding this you can update the parent version to the latest `SNAPSHOT` version and Maven should be able to find it.
