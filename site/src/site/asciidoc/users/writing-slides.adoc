== Writing slides

Slides are written using
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/reveal.js-converter/latest/converter/features/[Asciidoctor]. 
This document is not an attempt to be comprehensive, but, rather, to
give some helpful tips to get you started on your first presentation.

=== Slide format

Start each new slide with a title:

[code]
----
== Slide one

Text on the slide goes here

== !

no title on this one!

== Slide three

* Bullet
* List

----

== Images

You can put an image on a slide using the `image` syntax:

[code]
----
== Slide with image

image::pony.jpg[width=50%]
----

=== Advanced tips

For more examples of what you can do in your slides, have a look at the
default `index.html` files when you create a new presentation.

=== Speaker notes

The most important part of a presentation that you write for the
Training project is the speaker notes. You should think, while writing,
of the person who will pick up your presentation and attempt to present
it at a conference or meetup. Will they understand what it was that you
intended to communicate on each slide?

To add speaker notes, use the following syntax:

[code]
----
== New slide
