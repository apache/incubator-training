== Presentation Tips

This document discusses how to effectively use Apache Training presentations.

=== Opening a presentation

If you are presenting one of our published presentations, without any
modifications, then click on 'Presentations' in the navigation menu of
https://training.apache.org[training.apache.org], select the
presentation you want to deliver, and start!

However, since most of us will make at least minor modifications to
these presentations, you'll probably be presenting from your local build
of the slides.

You'll do this by getting a checkout of the presentation, making your
edits, and building it locally. The process for this is covered in
link::index.html#/getting-started[Getting Started], but is recapped here:

[code]
----
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-training.git
cd incubator-training/content
cd [path to your desired presentation]
cd ./src/main/asciidoc
[edit index.adoc to make your desired changes]
cd ../../../
mvn install
----

Your generated presentation is now in the directory
`target/generated-slides` and you can open the file `index.html` in that
director in your browser.

=== Speaker tools

Press **S** (for Speaker) to open the speaker tools. This will open a
second browser window with a preview of the next slide, and show you any
speaker notes that are available for the current slide.

It will also show you elapsed time, as well as timing advice for the current 
slide.  This pacing advice is derived from the `totalTime` parameter, divided by
the number of slides. This value defaults to 40 minutes (2400 seconds)
but you can set this to a desired value by putting the following at the
top of your `index.adoc` file:

[code]
----
// 30 minutes - 5 minutes Q&A = 1500 seconds
:revealjs_totalTime: 1500
----

This will then require that you rebuild your presentation.

=== Tips

Giving a good presentation is more than reading the slides. Here are
some tips for ensuring that you represent the ASF well.

* Read all of the speaker notes before going on stage. Consider
  rephrasing some of them in your own words to make it feel more
  natural.
* Practice giving the presentation. If you can, record yourself, and
  watch with a critical eye, or perhaps in front of a friend who is
  willing to give constructive feedback.
* If you're giving a talk in person, arrive at the venue a little early
  to be sure you can get your slides on the screen, and that everything
  is working as desired.
* If you're giving the talk remotely, be sure you are in a quiet place
  where you won't be disturbed. Put a sign on your door.
* Turn off your mobile phone. Empty your pockets. Remove your conference
  badge so that it won't interfere with the microphone.
* Use the microphone. No you are not loud enough without it. It's not
  for you, it's for your audience, and makes their experience better.
* Leave time for questions. Repeat every question, because the people in
  the back didn't hear it.
* If your talk was recorded, please consider sending us a link to the
  video, on dev@training.apache.org
