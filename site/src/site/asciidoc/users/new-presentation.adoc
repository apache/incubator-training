== Creating a New Presentation with Apache Training

To create a new Apache Training project, you'll need to generate the
directory tree of template files. If you've already built the tools, as
described in the link:index.html[getting started] doc, you should already
have all of the prerequisites to make this work. (So start there.)

Move to the directory where you wish to create your new presentation,
and run the following command:

    mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.training -DarchetypeArtifactId=content-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.3.0

For Windows, you need to wrap every argument in double-quotes:

    mvn archetype:generate "-DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.training" "-DarchetypeArtifactId=content-archetype" "-DarchetypeVersion=1.3.0"

This command will enter an interactive tool that will ask you some basic
questions about your new presentation.

In particular, you'll need to provide a `groupID` (to which you should
answer `org.apache.training` if you intend the presentation to
eventually be part of the Training.apache.org project, but otherwise
this can be whatever you like) and the `artifactID`, which will be the
name of the subdirectory that is created, where your presentation will
live.

You can accept the default answers to the remianing questions, by just
pressing enter at each prompt.

You'll then be asked to confirm your information, to which you will need
to respond `Y` for yes.

This will create a new directory tree containing your new presentation,
along with some sample content to get you started.

The directory tree will look like the following diagram:

           +-- resources
           |       +-- images
           |       |     +-- toddy.jpg
           +-- theme
                  +-- apache.css

== Editing your new presentation

Most of the content you'll need to edit when you're creating your
presentation  is in `src/main/asciidoc` and `src/main/resources`.

By default, `index.adoc` will contain many examples of what is possible
in asciidoctor, and you should spend some time reading through that. You
can also consult the
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/reveal.js-converter/latest/converter/features/[asciidoctor
presentation documentation] for a more comprehensive understanding of
the available syntax.

Images should go into `src/main/resources/images`. And the CSS that will
be used is in `src/main/theme/apache.css`.

Some of the default example files can be removed, and should be removed
if you're planning to contribute your presentation to the Training
project. These include:

    * `mermaid-flowchart-test.mmd`
    * `_b.adoc`
    * `_a.acoc`
    * `toddy.jpg`
`
Those files are provided purely as examples of what is possible.

== Building your new presentation

Change into the directory you have created, and run the following command
to build the template presentation:

    mvn install 

If this completes with no errors, there will a new directory 
`target/generated-slides` which contains the generated HTML content of
your presentation. Open the `index.html` in that directory in your
browser to start the presentation.
