Apache Training (incubating)
============================

### Purpose
The purpose of the Training project is to create high-quality training material for various projects in an open source form. Up until now everyone who wants to offer a Training course for one of the Apache projects needs to create her or his own slides/labs and keep them up-to-date. This is a significant investment of time and money. This project aims to spread that burden and help all Apache projects as we can create shared resources and we can also create cross-project training resources.

Furthermore, we intent to provide guidelines, and references, and quality standards for other ASF projects with respect to training material creation and release. In an ideal world, the knowledge about a particular ASF project can be provided and shared by the creators of those projects itselfe.

Finally, creation and sharing of ASF-related training materials will be another focus in the Apache Training project.

__To sum up, the main goals for this project:__

- Develop shared material that can be used for training 
- Specifically create material about the ASF, how it works and how best to contribute
- Cross-project
  - Focused on Apache but also 3rd party projects where it makes sense
  - Develop “labs” or “hands-on” exercises
  - Define and follow quality standards for training material
- Develop or document an infrastructure that can be used for those labs
- Provide procedures or develop tools to manage the material (e.g. a “slide” repository that contains “modules” that can be easily reused and combined)

__These are non-goals for this project:__

- Some kind of official “Apache Training Program” with certifications etc.
  - Based on feedback and future developments this may change but we believe it’s out of scope initially.
- The Apache training project does not provide the project documentation for arbitrary ASF projects, but rather helps to convert these into training material.
- The training material we develop is not necessarily self-explanatory. It still benefits from an experienced instructor but it will enable talented people without the time or resources for developing and maintaining material to provide training.

### Rationale
There are tons of companies offering training for and around the Apache ecosystem. From our experience, everyone is building a very similar set of slides and labs (there’s only so many ways you can explain a concept). This project aims to create and use synergies. By also bringing these resources closer to their origin we hope to improve quality, the freshness of the content and versatility (e.g. more language options).
Ideally, the ASF projects which collaborate with Apache Training will offer training material of comparable structure and high quality, so that 
self learners find a fast path towards application and/or contribution of/to the software projects.
Institutional training offers can also rely on the high content quality (regarding coverage and correctness) so the the ideas around good OSS spreads faster and wider.

It is the mission of the Apache foundation “to provide software for the public good” and we believe this project can help with that mission by making the software more accessible for a broader audience buy connecting those who have the knowledge with those who need it most.

### Current activities  (Q3: 2023)
We started the initiative to collaborate on a fundation for training materials with another ASF project.

A repository inspection tool has been started - the goal is to extract information from existing documentation and to identify gaps, so that the tasks for content creation can be planned in a targeted manner.

### Initial steps (pre 2023)
The initial goal for the first few weeks or months was to have discussions and agreements on various scoping and technical issues as well as integrating existing donated material.

From there we wanted to start building a library of content. The material can be found in the folder __content__.
