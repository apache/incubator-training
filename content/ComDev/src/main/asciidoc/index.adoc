== What is ComDev?
* 'Community Development' http://community.apache.org/
* It is a ASF project that isn't focussed on producing software
* It plays a key role in helping support collaboration and attracting new contributors
* Internal and external role

[NOTE.speaker]

How do we develop communities? We help support and grow them.
Why is it important to support communities? Shouldn they be able to support themselves? (Yes and No)
The objective is a self sustainting and supporting communitiy but there is a project lifecycle and sometimes projects need a little help just like anyone else.

== What is Community Development?
* Providing resources and information developing communities
* Supporting and helping communities grow 
* Attracting new contributors

== Why is it important to support open source communities?
[%step]
* Generally projects start small so need support to grow
* Open source is about being open and sharing the workload 
* Encourage sustainability and attract new contributors

== Contributors - The missing link?
* Lots open source projects and lots of potential contributors BUT
** People dont realise they can contribute 
** People dont know how to contribute
** People may not know where to find out or even ask
** People think only developers can contribute
* Projects are looking for you!

[NOTE.speaker]

The thing is that a lot of people dont realise that they can contribute, or dont know how to 
So the first thing we focus on is getting the message out to people to let them know that all our projects and I mean all of them are always looking for contributors. People to help with coding, documentation, event management, graphics, webdesign, training and anything else.

The second is giving them information on how to contribute and participate. So as a new person who doenst know anything. We help you get started.
