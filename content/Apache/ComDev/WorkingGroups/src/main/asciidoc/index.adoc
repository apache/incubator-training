== ComDev Working Groups

[%step]
* Why we made them.
* What they're for.
* Which ones have we started?
* How to get involved.

== A bit about ComDev

" ... charged with coordinating community development efforts."

[NOTE.speaker]
--

* ComDev exists to help projects build their communties
* Yes, projects should do this themselves, but having common practices and tools lowers the barrier
* ComDev is a PMC - a peer to other PMCs. It does *not* have authority over other PMCs.

--

== We are all ComDev

Key Point: ComDev does not do this work *for* you. It's a place 
for everyone to **collaborate on best practices** and tools that 
span all projects. Come join us.

ComDev is the ideal place for people with so-called "non-technical"
skills that they want to contribute to the ASF.

However, there is a tendency for people to wait for someone else to lead
before they get more deeply involved.

--

== What's a working group?

[%step]
* Like-minded people ...
* working towards a common goal ...
* collaboratively, in public

== Each group has

* Git repo - https://github.com/apache/comdev-working-groups
* A narrowly-defined goal or mission

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Narrowly defined so that there's no ambiguity, room for scope creep, or
potential to overlap/conflict with other efforts.
--

== Why?

After all, everyone knows that they can just dive in and start doing
stuff, right?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Yes, it's open source and "everyone knows" that they can come
contribute. But it can still be intimidating. People don't know where to
start.

People like to be asked. They like to be invited. They
like to be welcomed.
--

== Welcome

[NOTE.speaker]

The working groups exist to give explicit welcome and *permission* to
anyone who wants to participate.
--

== Hello, my name is

image::ask-me.jpg[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Having a "title" (I'm a member of the
Advisors working group!) gives people a feeling that they are authorized
to speak with that voice. It gives *explicit permission*. It also
encourages others to take them seriously ("oh, you're part of the
working group")

It also gives a structure within which to participate, and a recommended
way to get started.

--

== Working groups so far

== wg-wg

* For discussion of cross-working-group norms, process, or tools
* Purely advisory - WGs can do what they want - but wg-wg proposes
  structure and processes.
* Defines recommended way to start a new WG

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* This is where we document the ways that working groups should work.
* It's also where we can collaborate on shared resources or processes
  that benefit all WGs
--

== wg-advisors

* Advising projects and PMCs on best practice
* Seasoned ASF members and community managers
* It's important to respect a project's autonomy

[NOTE.speaker]
--

This is really no different from going to the project and volunteering
your expertise, but having the working group emboldens pepole to do this
work.

The primary goal is not so much to force people to do things a
particular way, but to streamline it for people who don't know how to
get started.

Ask first. You will probably be welcome, but don't assume. Be clear that
you're offering advice, but don't have standing to vote or enforce
anything. And once you've done this for a while, there's a chance that
some projects will invite you to stick around.

--

== wg-advisors, cont'd

* Get involved if
** You've been around the ASF a long time
** You're a Community Manager or Developer Advocate in your "real life"
** You have skills like metrics, doc writing, event planning or anything 
else that might be of value to an open source project

== wg-badging

image::fas-paranoid-panda.png[]

* "Badges" to celebrate accomplishments
* Still in idea phase - could use your help

== Fedora badges

image::fedora-badges.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--

Concept based on the Fedora badging system - https://badges.fedoraproject.org/

--

== Reddit badges

image::reddit-badges.png[scalewidth=50%]

[NOTE.speaker]
--

Worth noting that some people find this frivolous, or that it
trivializes what we do. Other people like earning achievements,
celebrating milestones, and trying new things.

If you don't like this idea, then accept that it's not for you, and move
on. You're not obliged to participate.

--

== wg-code-of-conduct

* Providing a recommended template for project code of conduct
** (Based on the Contributor Covenant)
** https://www.contributor-covenant.org/
* **NOT** an enforcing body, nor are we requiring any project to do anything

== wg-social

* AKA Party Working Group
* Orchestrating local **social** gathering of Apache enthusiasts
* See also ALC - Apache Local Communities - https://s.apache.org/alc
* Still in idea/startup stage

== wg-social-media

* Write and publish content on all social media platforms
* Amplify the messages of our projects, and help them craft better content
* Coordinate with M&P for consistent messaging
* Still in idea/startup stage

== wg-website

* Maintenance of the website
** https://community.apache.org/
* Yes, our website is objectively terrible. We know. Come help.

== wg-welcome

* Helping projects, and the ASF in general, be more welcoming
* e.g. ...
** helping projects write better project definitions
** answering beginner questions on dev@community or elsewhere

== wg-welcome - Sample answers

* (See Git repo)
* Provides sample/boilerplate answers to common questions

image::sample-answer.png[]

== Sample answers

* Why?
** Consistent messaging
** Thorough, friendly answers with links

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Using the recommended sample answer ensures that canonical links are
provided, and that we are giving people consistent answers.

Perhaps more importantly, it lets *anyone* jump in with the right
answer, and this gets more people engaged in community support.
--

== wg-your-idea-here

* Is there something you're passionate about and want to gather a group of like-minded people to work on it?
* Propose your WG on dev@community.apache.org

== How to communicate

image::wg-email.png[scaledwidth=75%]

* Send email to dev@community.apache.org
* Use a Subject: line tag identifying the working group

== Getting involved

* Show up
* Introduce yourself
* Say what you want to work on
* Then **start doing it**. You are allowed.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The key point here is that **you** are the owner of the working group.
You don't have to get permission or approval for your idea, as long as
you are transparent/public about what you're working on, and welcome
feedback and discussion.
