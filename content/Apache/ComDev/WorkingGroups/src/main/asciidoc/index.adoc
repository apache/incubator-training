== ComDev Working Groups

[%step]
* Why we made them.
* What they're for?
* Which ones have we created?
* How to get involved.

== A bit about ComDev

" ... charged with coordinating community development efforts."

[NOTE.speaker]
--

* ComDev exists to help projects build their communties
* Yes, projects should do this themselves, but having common practices and tools lowers the barrier
* ComDev is a PMC - a peer to other PMCs. It does *not* have authority over other PMCs.

--

== We are all ComDev

Key Point: ComDev does not do this work *for* you. It's a place 
for everyone to **collaborate on best practices** and tools that 
span all projects. Come join us.

[NOTE.speaker]
--

ComDev is the ideal place for people with so-called "non-technical"
skills that they want to contribute to the ASF.

--

== What's a working group?

* Like-minded people ...
* working towards a common goal ...
* collaboratively, in public

== Welcome

Yes, it's open source and "everyone knows" that they can come
contribute. But people like to be asked. They like to be invited. They
like to be welcomed.

The working groups exist to give explicit welcome and permission to
anyone who wants to participate. Come join us!

--

== wg-wg

* For discussion of cross-working-group norms, process, or tools

== wg-advisors

* Advising projecdts and PMCs on best practice
* Seasoned ASF members and community managers

[NOTE.speaker]
--

This is really no different from going to the project and volunteering
your expertise, but having the working group emboldens pepole to do this
work.

Ask first. You will probably be welcome, but don't assume.

== wg-badging

image::fas-paranoid-panda.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--

Concept based on the Fedora badging sysem - https://badges.fedoraproject.org/

--
