== ComDev Working Groups

[%step]
* Why we made them.
* What they're for.
* Which ones have we started?
* How to get involved.

== A bit about ComDev

" ... charged with coordinating community development efforts."

[.notes]
--

* ComDev exists to help projects build their communties
* Yes, projects should do this themselves, but having common practices and tools lowers the barrier
* ComDev is a PMC - a peer to other PMCs. It does *not* have authority over other PMCs.

--

== We are all ComDev

Key Point: ComDev does not do this work *for* you. It's a place 
for everyone to **collaborate on best practices** and tools that 
span all projects. Come join us.

ComDev is the ideal place for people with so-called "non-technical"
skills that they want to contribute to the ASF.

However, there is a tendency for people to wait for someone else to lead
before they get more deeply involved.

--

== What's a working group?

[%step]
* Like-minded people ...
* working towards a common goal ...
* collaboratively, in public

== Welcome

Yes, it's open source and "everyone knows" that they can come
contribute. But people like to be asked. They like to be invited. They
like to be welcomed.

The working groups exist to give explicit welcome and permission to
anyone who wants to participate. Come join us!

--

== wg-wg

* For discussion of cross-working-group norms, process, or tools

[.notes]
--
* This is where we document the ways that working groups should work.
* It's also where we can collaborate on shared resources or processes
  that benefit all WGs
--

== wg-wg: why?

image::cookie_cutter.jpg[scalewidth=50%]

[.notes]
--
Standardization across working groups makes it easier for people to join
another WG once they're familiar with how WGs work.

But flexibility is important too, when WGs have different needs. So this
group must work *with* all of the other groups to figure out what can be
shared, and what needs to be kept separate.

So far, it's only decided on some vague advice that WGs report up to the
ComDev PMC about their progress.
--

== wg-advisors

* Advising projecdts and PMCs on best practice
* Seasoned ASF members and community managers
* It's important to respect a project's autonomy

[.notes]
--

This is really no different from going to the project and volunteering
your expertise, but having the working group emboldens pepole to do this
work. And it makes projects more willing to accept the advice, as it's
part of an "official program".

Ask first. You will probably be welcome, but don't assume. Be clear that
you're offering advice, but don't have standing to vote or enforce
anything.

--

== wg-advisors

image::mentoring.jpg[scalewidth=50%]

<small>CC by Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland, on Flickr</small>

[.notes]
--
Every generation of a project is responsible for mentoring the next
generation. Failure to do do inevitably results in the drying up of new
ideas.

wg-advisors helps bridge that gap, and should *always* focus on enabling
the project community to do the work rather than doing it for them.
--

== How?

* Listen more than you speak
* Get to know key people, and corporate participants, engaged in the
  project
* Read board reports. Identify and solve problems
* Mentor people attempting to become committers or PMC members, who
  don't appear to be getting much support
* Just generally ... become a part of the community

== wg-badging

image::fas-paranoid-panda.png[]

* "Badges" to celebrate accomplishments
* Still in idea phase - could use your help

[.notes]
--

Concept based on the Fedora badging sysem - https://badges.fedoraproject.org/

--

== Fedora badges

image::fedora-badges.png[scalewidth=50%]

[.notes]
--
Some people love it. Some people say gamification trivializes hard work,
and rewards the wrong behavior. Come join the conversation.

What will we celebrate?
* First commit, 100th commit
* Becoming a commiter! Becoming a PMC member! Becoming a PMC chair!
* Attending events
* Being a RM
* Voted on a release
--

== Why this is hard

image::reddit-badges.png[]

[.notes]
--
There used to be a bunch of open source badging solutions. They have all
either gone closed source, or simply dried up.

Also, we would need to integrate with ASF LDAP in some way. And adhere
to GDPR and CRA and who knows what else. Come help.
--

== wg-code-of-conduct

* Providing a recommended template for project code of conduct
** (Based on the Contributor Covenant)
** https://www.contributor-covenant.org/

== Code of conduct: What it's *NOT*

* **NOT** an enforcing body, nor are we requiring any project to do anything
* **NOT** working on a Foundation-level global Code of Conduct

== wg-social

image::party.jpg[scalewidth=50%]

++++
<small>CC by Dr. Matthias Ripp, on Flickr</small>
++++

[.notes]
--

* Orchestrating local gathering of Apache enthusiasts
* AKA Party Working Group
* Still in idea/startup stage
--

== What wg-social might do

* Identify places where there's a concentration of ASF people, and
  encourage people visiting there to meet for a meal
* Revive the map? (Needs to respect privacy laws!)
* Gatherings at major tech events (FOSDEM, OSSummit, and so on)
* Geeky movie night!

[.notes]

Communities who eat together end up working together better. Identifying
your colleagues as human, and not just lines of code, tends to make
dealing with conflict a lot easier.
--

== ALC

See also ALC - Apache Local Communities - https://s.apache.org/alc -
that's something different.

== wg-social-media

image::twitter.png[]

[.notes]
--
* Write and publish content on all social media platforms
* Amplify the messages of our projects, and help them craft better content
* Coordinate with M&P for consistent messaging
* Still in idea/startup stage
--

== Questions to be addressed

* Should we keep using Twitter?
* Should we engage more in some other platform?
* What kind of content do we want to post?
* And, as always, the focus should remain on building strong ASF
  communities

== wg-website

https://community.apache.org/

image::website.png[]

[.notes]
--
* Yes, our website is objectively terrible. We know. Come help.
--

== wg-welcome

* Helping projects, and the ASF in general, be more welcoming
* e.g. ...
** helping projects write better project definitions
** answering beginner questions on dev@community or elsewhere

== wg-welcome - Sample answers

image::sample-answer.png[]

[.notes]
--

* (See Git repo)
* Provides sample/boilerplate answers to common questions
--

== Sample answers

* Why?
** Consistent messaging
** Thorough, friendly answers with links

[.notes]
--
Using the recommended sample answer ensures that canonical links are
provided, and that we are giving people consistent answers.
--

[.notes]
--
Perhaps more importantly, it lets *anyone* jump in with the right
answer, and this gets more people engaged in community support. Over
time, as they build their confidence, they can do more.
--

== !

image::shark.jpg[]

[.notes]
--
And, let's be honest, we are not always the most welcoming of people.
Questions like "how do I get involved" are *often* answered by "go look
at the projects lists and pick one and start doing stuff!" which is not
anything more than they already knew. Crafting helpful, welcoming
answers, and encouraging projects to do the same, will lead to more
welcoming contributor onboarding.
--

== wg-your-idea-here

* Is there something you're passionate about and want to gather a group of like-minded people to work on it?
* Propose your WG on dev@community.apache.org

[.notes]
--
Useful when you really think something should happen, but know that you
can't do it on your own. Come propose the WG!
--

== How to communicate

image::wg-email.png[scaledwidth=75%]

* Send email to dev@community.apache.org
* Use a Subject: line tag identifying the working group

== Getting involved

* Show up
* Introduce yourself
* Say what you want to work on
* Then **start doing it**. You are allowed.

[.notes]
--
The key point here is that **you** are the owner of the working group.
You don't have to get permission or approval for your idea, as long as
you are transparent/public about what you're working on, and welcome
feedback and discussion.
--

== Other working groups

Working groups outside of ComDev

== ORC WG

* Open Regulatory Compliance working group

image::orc_wg.png[]

[.notes]
--
Collaboration between Eclipse, Apache, and other open source
non-profits.
--

== Member-level working groups

* Governance committee
* Communication platforms WG

== Not a working group, but ...
