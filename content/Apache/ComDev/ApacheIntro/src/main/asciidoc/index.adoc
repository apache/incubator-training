== What am I going to cover?

* What is the ASF?
* How is an ASF project structured?
* How is the ASF structured?
* How does all of this work?

== What is the ASF?

* ASF = The Apache Software Foundation
* *US 501(c)3 charity* (Non-profit charity)
* Community of volunteers
* Virtual, world-wide organisation
* Provides organisational, legal and financial support for a large number of open-source projects

== The Apache Group

image::apache_8.png[250,250,float="right",align="center"]

* Before there was the ASF, there was the "Apache Group"
* Informal corporate structure
* 8 members
* Formed in Feb. 1995
* Continued the work on the NCSA httpd
* Chose a very promiscuous license

== Growth

== The mission

* *Provide software for the public good*
* Protect the trademark: *Apache* and her software products against misuse by other organisations
* Provide the technical and legal infrastructure for open-source development
* Provide all means to protect every volunteer from persecution as long as this persecution is aimed at a project of the foundation

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* legal infrastructure = Apache license, ICLA, CCLA, ...
* legal umbrella: If someone initiates legal action against an Apache committer for things related to the ASF, the ASF takes the place of the accused.
--

== The vision

The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects. The Apache projects are characterized by a *collaborative*, *consensus based* development process, an *open* and pragmatic software license, and a desire to create *high quality* software that leads the way in its field. We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a *community of developers and users*.

== Projects

* Heart of the ASF are the *projects*
* Also named "Top Level Project" (TLP)
* ASF provides services:
** Mailinglists, code-repositories (SVN, Git, ...)
** Bug & Issue trackers (Jira, ...), Wiki (Confluence, ...)
** CI Server (Jenkins, ...), Webservers for project websites
** ...

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Currently, there is a trend to use GitHub Issues, GitHub Discussions, GitHub Actions (CI)
* The ASF provides tooling to integrate these

* Members nominate and elect new members
* Members elect *board* (9 *directors*)
* Annual members meeting via IRC
* Monthly board meeting
* Every project elects a *Chair* as interface to the board

== If it didn't happen on the list, it didn't happen

* If something isn't documented on any of the mailing lists, it didn't happen
** Every discussion and decision needs to be documented
* All discussions should happen in the public
* Off-list discussions can happen, but important information needs to be forwarded to the mailing list
* Others are need to be able to participate

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Discussions on meetups or at conferences
* Many things (like votes) require 72 hour periods
* Private lists: Discussing security issues, voting on new committers and PMC members
--

== Community over Code

* We're (all) volunteers, life happens and our availability and our interests change
* A vital community encourages new community members
* It's normal, that members (temporarily) leave the community
* *Poisonous people* scare others and must be fought
* Result of a healthy community -> better code, long-lasting projects

== Consensus-based decisions

* PMC members have *binding votes*
* Non-PMC members have *non-binding votes*
* Formally only binding votes count
* *But* non-binding votes usually are still respected
* Something is considered decided if:
** At least 3 binding votes
** More `+1` as `-1` votes

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Valid votes are `+1` (pro), `0`, `-1` (contra)
* `-1` votes should be constructive
--

== Collaborative development

* Code should be developed in community with others
** Large code-drops are bad
* Development should happen on-line (Git/SVN, Email, ...)
* Votes ensure that at least 3 developers are still active
* In order to allow anyone to participate, votes usually last at least 72 hours
* Discussions and votes happen only on the mailing-list

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* 72h = at least one working day, no matter where on earth you live
--

== The result

* Vendor neutrality
* Diversity
* Trust
* Safety
* Security

== How can companies help?

* Companies can allow their employees to contribute during working hours
* Companies can directly support the ASF financially (Sponsoring)
* Companies can donate code, so everyone can profit from it
* Companies can't directly fund development in projects
* Companies can donate funds towards projects (Targeted donations)

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Targeted donations: Licenses, Hardware costs, Membership fees, ...
