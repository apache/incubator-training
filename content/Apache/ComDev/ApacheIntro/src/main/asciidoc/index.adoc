== What am I going to cover?

* What is the ASF?
* How is an ASF project structured?
* How is the ASF structured?
* How does all of this work?

== What is the ASF?

* ASF = The Apache Software Foundation
* *US 501(c)3 charity* (Non-profit charity)
* Community of volunteers
* Virtual, world-wide organisation
* Provides organisational, legal and financial support for a large number of open-source projects

== The Apache Group

image::apache_8.png[250,250,float="right",align="center"]

* Before there was the ASF, there was the "Apache Group"
* Informal organizational structure
* 8 members
* Formed in Feb. 1995
* Continued the work on the NCSA httpd
* Wrote a very permissive license, based on previous work

[.notes]
--
* The Apache License was intended to be a "universal donor" that
  projects and organizations could consume.
* Traded patches on a mailing list

== The mission

* *Provide software for the public good*
* Provide all means to protect every volunteer from prosecution as long as this prosecution is aimed at a project of the foundation
* Provide a place for projects to develop in a vendor-neutral environment

[.notes]
--
* legal umbrella: If someone initiates legal action against an Apache committer for things related to the ASF, the ASF takes the place of the accused
* Vendor neutrality: Projects are directed by the individual contributors doing the work, not corporate product teams

--

== The vision

The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects. The Apache projects are characterized by a *collaborative*, *consensus based* development process, an *open* and pragmatic software license, and a desire to create *high quality* software that leads the way in its field. We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a *community of developers and users*.

== Projects

* Heart of the ASF are the *projects*
* ASF provides services:
** Infrastructure
** Marketing, Legal, Security services
** Advice and experience to direct governance and community

[.notes]
--

* Projects ...
** *Usually* produce software, but we have some outliers
** Managed by a PMC (more in coming slides)
* Infra
** Mailing lists, code-repositories (SVN, Git, ...)
** Bug & Issue trackers (Jira, ...), Wiki (Confluence, ...)
** CI Server (Jenkins, ...), Web servers for project websites
* Other services
** Conferences
** M&P
** Legal
** Public Policy
** ComDev
** etc, etc

* Projects don't start at Apache
* Projects can also leave any time
** .. But the ASF owns the marks
** Will need to re-brand

== How is the ASF structured?

* *Member* based - only individuals can join (no companies)
* Members nominate and elect new members
* Members elect *board* (9 *directors*)
* Annual members meeting via IRC
* Monthly board meeting
* Every project elects a *Chair* as interface to the board

== If it didn't happen on the list, it didn't happen

* If something isn't documented on any of the mailing lists, it didn't happen
** Every discussion and decision needs to be documented
* All discussions should happen in the public
* Off-list discussions can happen, but important information needs to be forwarded to the mailing list
* Others need to be able to participate
* Archived for future reference and research

[.notes]
--
* Discussions on meetups or at conferences
* Many things (like votes) require 72 hour periods
* Private lists: Discussing security issues, voting on new committers and PMC members
--

== Community over Code

* We're (all) volunteers, life happens and our availability and our interests change
* A vital community welcomes, mentors, and encourages new community members
* It's normal, that members (temporarily) leave the community
* *Poisonous people* scare others and must be fought
* Result of a healthy community -> better code, long-lasting projects

== Consensus-based decisions

* PMC members have *binding votes*
* Non-PMC members have *non-binding votes*
* Formally only binding votes count
* *But* non-binding votes usually are still respected
* Something is considered decided if:
** At least 3 binding votes
** More `+1` than `-1` votes

[.notes]
--
* Valid votes are `+1` (pro), `0`, `-1` (contra)
* `-1` votes should be constructive
* Non-binding votes should inform decisions. They're also a good way to
  identify potential contributors.
--

== Collaborative development

* Code should be developed in community with others
** Large code-drops are bad
* Development should happen on-line (Git/SVN, Email, ...)
* Votes ensure that at least 3 developers are still active
* In order to allow anyone to participate, votes usually last at least 72 hours
* Discussions and votes happen only on the mailing-list

[.notes]
--
* 72h = at least one working day, no matter where on earth you live, and
  give the ability for people to take a weekend off without being cut
  out of discussion.
--

== The result

* Vendor neutrality
* Diversity
* Trust
* Safety
* Security

== How can companies help?

* Companies can allow their employees to contribute during working hours
* Companies can directly support the ASF financially (Sponsoring)
* Companies can donate code, so everyone can profit from it
* Companies can't directly fund development in projects
* Companies can donate funds towards projects (Targeted donations)

[.notes]
--
* Targeted donations: Licenses, Hardware costs, Membership fees, ...
