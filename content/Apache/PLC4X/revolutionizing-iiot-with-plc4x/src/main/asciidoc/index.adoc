[quote, Apache PLC4X Project Statement]
PLC4X is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API.

== Apache PLC4X

* https://plc4x.apache.org
* Allows writing software for any type of PLC
* When changing the PLC, only configuration needs to be adjusted
* Strong growing number of supported protocols
* Strong growing number of programming languages
* Strong growing number of integration modules
* Support of features, which protocols generally don't support
* Make PLC Data available in a unified way

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Modbus generally only allows bits and short values
* Unified data: PlcValues all handled equally over all protocols
* Unified Namespace
--

== PLC4X Supported Operations

* Read icon:check[role=green]
* Write icon:check[role=green]
* Subscription icon:check[role=green]
** Cyclic
** On Value Change
** Event/Alarm
* Discovery icon:hammer[role=orange]
* Browse icon:hammer[role=orange]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* We're currently working a lot on Discovery and Browsing
* Discovery: Which devices do I have and how can I connect to them?
* Browse: Which resources do these devices have?

== Polyglot PLC4X

* Supporting multiple languages was planned from the start
** The `X` in PLC4X stands for the multiple Languages
* Writing PLC driver code is easy
* Understanding the protocols is hard
* As soon as a protocol is "understood", create drivers in many languages
* Cross-compiling/wrapping just wouldn't feel right
* Heavy lifting done by our code-generation framework

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Cross Compiling:
** Increased Size
** Strange API feeling in other language
--

== What can you do with PLC4X?

== Making machine data visible

image::sp-data-explorer-3.png[]

== Overall Equipment Efficiency

image::digital-cockpit.png[]

== Predictive Maintenance

* Predict when a device needs maintenance
* Predict probable failures
* Run the machine at the right speed to minimize
** Wear & tear
** Energy-consumption
** Resource usage

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Increased energy consumption -> needs maintenance
--

== What could you do beyond that?

* Following use-cases not yet fully implemented
* From my experience, what the industry is really missing
* Would need some extra work

== PLC "Simulator" for unit-tests

* In manufacturing engeineering almost no unit-testing done
* If testing is done, then only on the real machine
* Usually only happy-path testing
* Solution:
** PLC4X stand-alone application: "Simulator"
** Built to speak with PLC4X drivers (Not full protocol support)
** Use PLC4X to set values in the "PLC" from the Unit-Test
** Test PLC4X Application against the simulator without needing real machinery

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* The simulator already exists
* Need to implement:
** General memory management
** "Subscriptions"
--

== Historian

* Historians are sort of ancient time-series databases
* Mostly required for regulations
* Extremely expensive
* Don't scale
* Solution:
** Use Apache PLC4X to get the data
** Use Apache IoTDB to store the data
** Add interfaces to replicate Historian interfaces

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* We're already working on Apache Historian
* However mainly me working on it
--

== Digital Twin

* Everyone is talking about Digital Twins
* No good products available yet
* Not expecting any OT-vendor product to be usable
* Solution:
** Use Apache PLC4X to get the data
** Use Apache IoTDB to store the timeseries data
** Use Eclipse Dito to store the current state
** Use Apache KIE (incubating) to do smart things with the data

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* IoTDB is great for time-series data
* Ditto is great for current state and dependencies
* KIE (Knowledge is everything): Contains Drools, jBPM
--

== MES replacement

* MES = Manufacturing Execution System
* Big, fat, slow and don't scale
* Products today way more customizable:
** A lot more interaction between PLC and MES needed
** A lot more to do for the MES
** MES becomes the bottleneck
* Solution:
** Building a distributed MES based on principle of highly scalable distributed systems

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Cars today usually so customizable, that there are only very few equal configurations
* PLC needs to ask MES about options for every produced item
