Training

The Training project aims to develop resources which can be used for training purposes in various media formats, languages and for various Apache and non-Apache target projects.

Training has been incubating since 2019-02-21.

In June 2023, we started adjusting the project goals. Besides a pure focus on content creation tools we have identified the need for two additional aspects:

(1) For ASF processes some documentation exists, e.g. https://community.apache.org/contributor-ladder, but the ASF member journey is still a challenge for many new members, especially those with less coding experience. 
As a solution it has been suggested to provide training material for the following problems: 
* You've just graduated to a TLP. What are the challenges you will now face?
* New committer onboarding
* New PMC member onboarding
* New PMC Chair onboarding
* New board member onboarding

(2) Creation of some general recommendations/guidelines for:
 * managing/validation of training material contributions of arbitrary ASF projects has been propsed.

We expand our focus now on the following aspects:

We have to work on strategies to increase the participation and the visibility of the project and its goals.

Besides requests for contributions from individual contributors from other Apache projects we want to show what the Apache Training project can offer to those projects.

We should build on the assumption that synergy and network effects can help us to increase the community around training and skill management topics.




Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

Improve the community participation (other Apache projects should actively be linked to this project, since they "have the content")
(Re)define the short-, mid-, and long-term goals of the project.
Select an approach to handle non coding / non document related tasks (e.g., community related activities on events)
Create a strategy how this projects contributes to or is supported by other Apache projects
Create a tutorial on how the tools provided by this project can be used to create own content
Review current policies around contribution review and releases to find a pragmatic compromise

Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

The Training Project needs more contribution from other Apache projects, hence a clear communication strategy for interlinking existing projects with the Apache Training project is needed.

We need feedback from other Apache projects on the presentations and trainings developed till now.

In order to improve this collaboration we suggest to investigate the status of other project’s documentation in a systematic approach, especially with an eye on available training related material.



How has the community developed since the last report?

 - no changes




How has the project developed since the last report?

 - Initial discussion regarding usage of content created/delivered by LLMs has been started.
 - In July, a first documentation inspection and fact extraction tool (Python script) has been provided.
 - A pull request is open: https://github.com/apache/incubator-training/pull/87.




How would you assess the podling's maturity?

There are currently some issues with this podling that we are working to address, we believe that the issues are not yet critical and can be turned around from within the community but want to make the board aware of this early on.

 - Initial setup oft he project’s structure: Goals and strategy needs refinement.
   Working towards first release: What type of artefacts to release is not clear, due to unclear goals and strategy.
   Community building: The community exists of a very small number of people but is more or less invisible, as of today (April 2023).
   Nearing graduation: Currently, we are still pretty far away from graduation, but we get closer.




When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?

 - November 2020




Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

 - Mentors have been responsive and helpful when reached out to.




Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?

 - The name search process has not yet been started, as there is still time to do that if and when graduation draws nearer.

 - The PPMC is actively monitoring usage of the Podlings current name on other sites.

 - The Podling is not directly affiliating with any sponsors donating content and presenting an independent image on the webpage.
